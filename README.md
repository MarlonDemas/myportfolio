## Introduction

Online Dev Portfolio for Marlon Demas using mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also used the Bulma framework and SASS as a preprocessor for CSS.

## Purpose

To showcase my coding skills for a career in web development.

## Setting up my workspace

- Created Repository
- Opened terminal and launched the command 'git clone "repo link"'
- Created index.html file
- Created base folder structure (sass, css, img and js)
- Pushed Changes

### Repo link
```
https://github.com/MarlonDemas/online-cv.git

```

## Getting Started

1. In the repository copy the link at the Clone or download button.

2. Open git bash and type "git clone" then paste the copied link and press enter.

3. Cd into the folder then copy the path.

4. Create a virtual host using wamp, lamp or mamp with the name of your choosing and paste the path to create your virtual host.

5. Refresh wamp and then open the virtual host and then you can do the quiz and see how much you know.
