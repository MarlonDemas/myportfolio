# Portfolio

## Introduction

Online Dev Portfolio for Marlon Demas using mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also used the Bulma framework and SASS as a preprocessor for CSS.

## Purpose

To showcase my coding skills for a career in web development.

## Setting up my workspace

- Created Repository
- Opened terminal and launched the command 'git clone "repo link"'
- Created index.html file
- Created base folder structure (sass, css, img and js)
- Pushed Changes
